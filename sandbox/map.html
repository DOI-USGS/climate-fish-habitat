      <h3>Welcome to the interactive map for viewing current and future predicted conditions for walleye and largemouth bass in Wisconsin lakes!</h3>
      
      <h4>Lakes are colored based on predicted habitat conditions for each species. Double-click on a lake for more information.</h4>
      <h4>Predictions of species dominance are available for three time periods - contemporary conditions (1989-2014), and two future periods (2040-2064, and 2065-2089).</h4>
      
      <ul>
        <li>"Walleye lakes” are predicted to have habitat conditions capable of supporting naturally reproducing walleye populations (>49% probability) but not high largemouth bass abundance (<49% probability).</li>
        <li>"Bass lakes” are predicted to have the habitat conditions capable of supporting high largemouth bass abundance (>49% probability) but not naturally reproducing walleye populations (<49% probability).</li>
        <li>"Coexistence" lakes are predicted have the habitat conditions capable of supporting both naturally reproducing walleye populations (>49% probability) and high largemouth bass abundance (>49% probability).</li>
        <li>"Neither" lakes are predicted to support neither naturally reproducing walleye populations (<49% probability) nor high largemouth bass abundance (<49% probability).</li>
      </ul>

      <div id="disclaimer">
        <h4>Disclaimer: Lake-specific predictions are based on modeled water temperature data and other lake conditions such as lake size. Future projections are based on a high-end climate change scenario, and are uncertain. Generally, interpreting projections for a specific lake should be done with caution as many factors were not considered (e.g. other fish species, land-use changes, stocking). Projected shifts from a "Walleye lake"" to a "Bass lake" should be viewed as a shift in the thermal habitat conditions and fish community as opposed to a certain future state where Largemouth Bass overpopulate the lake.</h4>
