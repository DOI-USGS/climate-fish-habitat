			<div id="drawConclusionsText">
  		<p>GDD are a measure of cumulative temperature over the entire open water  season of a lake (from ice-out to ice-on). Higher GDD means warmer water,  lower GDD means cooler water. In this case, we used a base temperature of  5 degrees C (41 degrees F). We calculated GDD for each lake and each year:  for each day that the water temperature was above 5 degrees C, subtract 5  from the water temperature (in C) for that day. GDD is the sum of all of those numbers for the entire year.</p>

  		  <p>We're giving you a hint to help you fill out the pattern for Walleye and Largemouth Bass.  Walleye are most likely to reproduce in cooler lakes. Largemouth Bass are more likely to reach high abundance in warmer lakes, so their line looks like this:

	    <p>Importantly, the relationships between water temperature and fish identified in this study are based on correlations.  We know that walleye natural reproduction is more frequent in cooler lakes, and we know largemouth bass reach high  densities more often in warmer lakes. However, we do not know the reasons behind these relationships. Water temperatures  in most Wisconsin lakes are not predicted to get too warm for walleye to survive in the foreseeable future. We can only  speculate about the true cause for failed walleye reproduction in warmer lakes. We believe a number of factors may be at  play, including potential mismatches between young walleyeâ€™s need for food and the availability of that food, increased  competition and/or predation, increased need for food due to warmer temperatures, or a combination of these and other factors.</p>
