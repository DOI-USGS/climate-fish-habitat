walleyeDecline-keynote-1: Walleye populations in many Wisconsin lakes are declining, 
walleyeDecline-keynote-2: while largemouth bass populations in many lakes are increasing
walleyeDecline-intro: >-
  Walleye are a preferred species for many anglers, and important to Wisconsinâ€™s economy and culture.

walleyeDecline-p1: >-
  Some have hypothesized that largemouth bass are directly responsible for walleye declines. 
  However, evidence to date does not support this claim.

walleyeBass-keynote-1: Walleye and largemouth bass thrive in different types of lakes
walleyeBass-intro: >- 
  The lake conditions that are best for one species are generally not the best for the other. 
  Temperature is key characteristic determining the suitability of a lake for walleye or largemouth bass.
walleyeBass-l1: Walleye prefer cool water
walleyeBass-l2: LMB prefer warm water

    We're giving you a hint to help you fill out the pattern for Walleye and Largemouth Bass - 
    for the warmest lakes in Wisconsin, you are more likely to find Bass than Walleye, so your starting points look like this:
walleyeBass-hint-2: >-  
  . It's up to you to figure out what happens in colder lakes. If you think it is equally likely to find Bass in all Wisconsin lakes, your line would look like this:
walleyeBass-hint-3: >-  
  if you think Bass stop showing up abruptly in colder lakes, your line would look like this:
walleyeBass-hint-4: >-  
  Likewise, if Walleye are less common in colder lakes, your line would look like this:

lakeWarming-keynote-1: Lakes in Wisconsin have gotten warmer over the past 30 years
lakeWarming-intro: Some lakes have warmed more than others
lakeWarming-p1: >-
  Lake size, depth, clarity, and tree cover surrounding the lake all influence how much lakes have warmed.
