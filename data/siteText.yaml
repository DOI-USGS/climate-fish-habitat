walleyeDecline-keynote-1: Walleye populations in many Wisconsin lakes are declining, 
walleyeDecline-keynote-2: while largemouth bass populations in many lakes are increasing
walleyeDecline-intro: >-
  Walleye are a preferred species for many anglers, and important to Wisconsinâ€™s economy and culture.

walleyeDecline-p1: >-
  Some have hypothesized that largemouth bass are directly responsible for walleye declines. 
  However, evidence to date does not support this claim.

walleyeBass-keynote-1: Walleye and largemouth bass thrive in different types of lakes
walleyeBass-intro: >- 
  The lake conditions that are best for one species are generally not the best for the other. 
  Temperature is a key characteristic in determining the suitability of a lake for walleye or largemouth bass.
walleyeBass-interactive-setup: Can you draw the relationship between these two fish and lake temperature?
walleyeBass-l1: Walleye prefer cool water
walleyeBass-l2: LMB prefer warm water

    We're giving you a hint to help you fill out the pattern for Walleye and Largemouth Bass. 
    For the colder lakes in Wisconsin, you are more likely to find Walleye than Bass, so your starting points look like this:
walleyeBass-hint-2: >-  
  . It's up to you to figure out what happens in warmer lakes. If you think it is equally likely to find Bass in all Wisconsin lakes, your line would look like this:
walleyeBass-hint-3: >-  
  if you think Bass start showing up abruptly in warmer lakes, your line would look like this:
walleyeBass-hint-4: >-  
  Likewise, if Walleye are more common in warmer lakes, your line would look like this:
walleyeBass-hint-5: >-  
  or the same for all lakes: 

lakeWarming-keynote-1: Lakes in Wisconsin have gotten warmer over the past 30 years
lakeWarming-intro: Some lakes have warmed more than others
lakeWarming-p1: >-
  Lake size, depth, clarity, and tree cover surrounding the lake all influence how much lakes have warmed.
