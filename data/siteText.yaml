walleyeDecline-keynote-1: Walleye populations in many Wisconsin lakes are declining, 
walleyeDecline-keynote-2: while largemouth bass populations in many lakes are increasing
walleyeDecline-intro: >-
  Walleye are a preferred species for many anglers, and important to Wisconsin’s economy and culture.

walleyeDecline-p1: >-
  Some have hypothesized that largemouth bass are directly responsible for walleye declines. 
  However, evidence to date does not support this claim.

walleyeBass-keynote-1: Walleye and largemouth bass thrive in different types of lakes. 
walleyeBass-keynote-2: The lake conditions that are best for one species are generally not the best for the other
walleyeBass-intro: Temperature is key characteristic determining the suitability of a lake for walleye or largemouth bass.
walleyeBass-l1: Walleye prefer cool water
walleyeBass-l2: LMB prefer warm water
walleyeBass-l3: >-
  The relationship for each species shows a threshold response – the shape is flat above and below a certain point. All lakes below a certain temperature threshold are equally suitable for walleye (on average), and all lakes above that threshold are equally unsuitable for walleye (on average). Reverse is true for LMB.
walleyeBass-l4: >-  
  The relationships between the two species cross – there is a threshold temperature that separates good walleye lakes from good bass lakes.
  

lakeWarming-keynote-1: Lakes in Wisconsin have gotten warmer over the past 30 years
lakeWarming-intro: Some lakes have warmed more than others
lakeWarming-p1: >-
  Lake size, depth, clarity, and tree cover surrounding the lake all influence how much lakes have warmed.
