    Understanding recent trends and anticipating future changes can help decision-makers protect resilient populations and adapt to new conditions.


walleyeDecline-keynote-1: Walleye populations in many Wisconsin lakes are declining, 
walleyeDecline-keynote-2: while largemouth bass populations in many lakes are increasing
walleyeDecline-bullets: 
  - Anglers target both walleye and largemouth bass in Wisconsin lakes.
  - Walleye are preferred by many anglers, and are important to Wisconsin’s economy and culture.
  - Much interest exists in understanding the causes of walleye population declines and whether they can be reversed.
  - There are many possible explanations for the observed changes in Wisconsin lake fish communities.
  - Some have hypothesized that largemouth bass are directly responsible for walleye declines. However, evidence to date does not support this claim.

  Statewide average values over time for walleye natural reproduction (blue; indexed as catch of young walleye 
  hatched in that year caught per mile of electrofishing) and largemouth bass relative abundance (red; indexed 
  as catch of largemouth bass greater than 8 inches per mile of electrofishing, presented on a standardized scale). 
  Dashed lines show overall directional trend over time.

walleyeBass-keynote-1: Walleye and largemouth bass thrive in different types of lakes
walleyeBass-interactive-setup: Can you draw the relationship between these two fish and lake temperature?
walleyeBass-bullets: 
  - Water temperature influences the suitability of a lake for walleye and largemouth bass.
  - In general, walleye reproduce more successfully in cooler lakes, and largemouth bass populations are most abundant in warm lakes.
  - Both species exhibit a threshold response to temperature, where small changes in temperature can produce big changes in the fish population.
  - The temperature threshold separating lakes with successful vs. unsuccessful walleye reproduction is approximately the same threshold separating lakes with low vs. high largemouth bass abundances.
  - This means that lakes with the best habitat for natural walleye reproduction generally do not have the habitat to support high largemouth bass abundance, and vice versa
  - These relationships are averages. Other lake characteristics influence the suitability of the lake for each species. For example, walleye can reproduce successfully in large lakes even if they are warm.
walleyeBass-GDD: >-
  Lake temperature in this study is measured as growing degree days (GDD). 
  GDD are a measure of cumulative temperature over the entire open water 
  season of a lake (from ice-out to ice-on). Higher GDD means warmer water, 
  lower GDD means cooler water. In this case, we used a base temperature of 
  5 degrees C (41 degrees F). We calculated GDD for each lake and each year: 
  for each day that the water temperature was above 5 degrees C, subtract 5 
  from the water temperature (in C) for that day. GDD is the sum of all of those numbers for the entire year.
walleyeBass-hint-1: >-
    We're giving you a hint to help you fill out the pattern for Walleye and Largemouth Bass. 
    For the colder lakes in Wisconsin, you are more likely to find Walleye than Bass. Bass are more commonly found in warmer lakes 
    so their line looks like this:
walleyeBass-hint-2: >-  
  . It's up to you to figure out what happens to walleye in warmer lakes. If Walleye are more common in warmer lakes, your line would look like this:
walleyeBass-hint-3: >- 
  or less common in warmer lakes:

  Predicted probability of a lake supporting successful walleye recruitment and high largemouth bass abundance as a 
  function of water temperature (growing degree days). Probabilities are based on a statistical model that incorporates other 
  lake characteristics such as water clarity and lake size.

lakeWarming-keynote-1: Lakes in Wisconsin have gotten warmer over the past 30 years
lakeWarming-bullets: 
  - Not all lakes are the same, and they respond differently to climate.
  - Some lakes have warmed more than others.
  - Some lakes have always been warmer than others - for example, lakes in southern Wisconsin are generally warmer than lakes in northern Wisconsin.
  - Lake size and depth, water clarity, and surrounding tree cover all influence how lakes respond to climate.
  - Differences in water temperature affect the suitability of a lake's habitat for supporting different fish species.
lakeWarming-caption: >-
  Lake warming since 1980 across the studied lakes of Wisconsin. The rate of warming is variable across 
  lakes and depends on geography and the type of lake (clear or dark, large or small). Warming shown here
  is based on modeled lake temperature for 1980 to 2014. 
  
futureWarming-keynote-1: Lakes are expected to get even warmer in the future
futureWarming-bullets:
 - Scientists agree that the earth will get warmer through the end of the 21st century. However, the amount of warming and how other climate conditions such as precipitation and wind will change is uncertain.
 - We estimated how water temperatures of Wisconsin lakes would change assuming a relatively large increase in air temperature. These predictions can be considered a "worst case scenario" in terms of the amount of warming.
 - As air temperatures increase, we expect lake temperatures to increase as well.
 - However, not all lakes will respond equally to climate change.
 - The incredible diversity of lake types in Wisconsin means that we can expect different warming rates in big vs. small lakes, deep vs. shallow lakes, clear vs. turbid lakes.
 - Understanding differences among lakes in their responses to climate change is a high priority for managing fish populations that are sensitive to warming temperatures.

futureSuitability-keynote-1: In the future, many lakes in Wisconsin are expected to become 
futureSuitability-keynote-2: less suitable for walleye and more suitable for largemouth bass
futureSuitability-bullets: 
  - As water temperatures get warmer, lakes that currently can support natural walleye reproduction will no longer have the habitat conditions to do so.
  - The majority of Wisconsin lakes are predicted to have habitat conditions suitable for high largemouth bass densities by the mid-21st century.
  - A small percentage of lakes will continue to maintain habitat conditions for supporting both species into the future.
  - >-
    Although a small number of lakes in Wisconsin have the habitat conditions to support natural walleye reproduction, 
    the lakes that do support natural walleye reproduction tend to be the largest lakes. 
    Lakes with the conditions for supporting high largemouth bass populations tend to be smaller lakes.

  Number of lakes classified by their ability to support walleye and largemouth bass predicted 
  species dominance under contemporary (1989-2014), mid-century future 2040-2064), 
  and late-century future (2065-2089) conditions. Hover over the figure to see the number of 
  lakes moving between categories. Lakes are classified based on their predicted probabilities 
  of walleye recruitment and largemouth bass relative abundance. Classes are defined as: walleye 
  lakes (blue; walleye recruitment success and low largemouth bass relative abundance), coexistence 
  (purple; walleye recruitment success and high largemouth bass relative abundance), largemouth bass 
  lakes (orange; walleye recruitment failure and high largemouth bass relative abundance), or neither 
  (grey; walleye recruitment failure and low largemouth bass relative abundance). Colored lines show 
  projected movements among lake classes, and line width is proportional to the number of lakes moving 
  between each class. Numbers are based on median projections across multiple global climate models.

  Lakes will respond differently to climate change depending on their size, depth, water 
  clarity, and starting temperatures, as demonstrated by the different trajectories of Lake 
  Mendota, Green Lake, and Trout Lake.
  
fishManagement-keynote-1: We can manage lakes to protect walleye where they are likely to thrive
fishManagement-bullets: 
  - Nearly 100 lakes in Wisconsin are predicted to support naturally reproducing walleye populations even under extreme warming conditions.
  - These lakes are resilient to climate change, and should be protected from other stressors such as habitat loss, invasive species, or overfishing to maximize the potential for continued walleye production.
  - Some lakes that are unlikely to support natural walleye reproduction will continue to be suitable for adult walleye, and fishable walleye populations could potentially be maintained in these lakes via stocking.
  - Quality fishing opportunities for largemouth bass and other warm water species will be possible in lakes that become unsuitable for walleye.
